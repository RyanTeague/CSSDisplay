    <!--CSS Layout - The display property
    
        The display property is the most important CSS property for 
        controlling layout.
    -->

    <!--The display Property
    
        The display property is used to specify how an element is shown on a 
        web page.

        Every HTML element has a defualt display value, depending on what type of
        element it is. The default display value for most elements is block or 
        inline.

        The display property is used to change the default display behavior of
        HTML elements.
    -->

    <!--Block-level Elements
    
        A block-level element Always starts on a new line and takes up full
        width abaliable (strecthes out to the left and fright as for as it can).

        the <div> element is a block-level element.
        
        Examples of block-level elements:

        Examples of block-level element:

        . <div>
        . <h1> - <h6>
        . <p>
        . <from>
        . <header>
        . <footer>
        . <section>
    -->

    <!--Inline Elements
    
        An inline element DOSE NOT start on a new line and only takes up as much
        width as necessary.

        This is an inline <span> element inside a paragraph.

        Example of inline elements:

        . <span>
        . <a>
        . <img>

    -->

    <!--The display property Values
    
        The display property has many values:

inline	Displays an element as an inline element
block	Displays an element as a block element
contents	Makes the container disappear, making the child elements children of the element the next level up in the DOM
flex	Displays an element as a block-level flex container
grid	Displays an element as a block-level grid container
inline-block	Displays an element as an inline-level block container. The element itself is formatted as an inline element, but you can apply height and width values
inline-flex	Displays an element as an inline-level flex container
inline-grid	Displays an element as an inline-level grid container
inline-table	The element is displayed as an inline-level table
list-item	Let the element behave like a <li> element
run-in	Displays an element as either block or inline, depending on context
table	Let the element behave like a <table> element
table-caption	Let the element behave like a <caption> element
table-column-group	Let the element behave like a <colgroup> element
table-header-group	Let the element behave like a <thead> element
table-footer-group	Let the element behave like a <tfoot> element
table-row-group	Let the element behave like a <tbody> element
table-cell	Let the element behave like a <td> element

initial	Sets this property to its default value
inherit	Inherits this property from its parent element
    -->

<!--Display: none;

    display: none; is commonly used with JavaScript to hide and show 
    elements without deleting and recreating them. Take a look at our last 
    example on this page if you want to know how this can be achieved.

The <script> element uses display: none; as default.
-->

<!--Override The Default Display Value

    As mention, every element has a default display value. However, you can
    override this.

    Changeing an inline element to a block element, or vice versa, can be useful
    for making the page look a specific way, and still follow the web standards.

    A common example is making inline <li> elements for horizontal menus:
-->

<p>Display a list of links as a horizontal menu:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/html/default.asp" target="_blank">HTML</a></li>
  <li><a href="/css/default.asp" target="_blank">CSS</a></li>
  <li><a href="/js/default.asp" target="_blank">JavaScript</a></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<!--Note: Setting the display property of an element only changes how the
element is displayed, NOT what kind of element it is. So, an inline
element with display: blcok; is not allowed to have other block elements inside it.
-->

<!--The following example displays <span> elements as block elements:
-->

<h1>Display span elements as block elements</h1>

<span>A display property with</span> <span>a value of "block" results in</span> <span>a line break between each span elements.</span>

<hr>

<!--The following exapmle displays <a> elements as block elements:-->

    <h1>Display links as block elements</h1>

    <a href="/html/default.asp" target="_blank">HTML</a>
    <a href="/css/default.asp" target="_blank">CSS</a>
    <a href="/js/default.asp" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>

<hr>

<!--Hide an ELement - display: none or 
    visibility: hiddne

    Hiding an element can be done by setting the display property to none.
    The element will be hidden, and the page will be display as if the element
    is not there:
-->

<h1>This is a visible heading</h1>
<h1 class="hidden">This is a hidden heading</h1>
<p>Notice that the h1 element with display: none; does not take up any space.</p>

<hr>

<!--visibility: hidden; also hides an element.

    Howevery, the element will still take up the smae space as before. The
    element will be hidden, but still affect the layout:
-->

<h1>This is a visible heading</h1>
<h1 class="hidden">This is a hidden heading</h1>
<p>Notice that the hidden heading still takes up space.</p>

<!--More Examples

    Differences between display: none; and visibility: hidden;
    This example demonstrates display: none; versus visiblity: hidden;
